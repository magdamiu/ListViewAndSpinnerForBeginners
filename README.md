# ListView And Spinner For Beginners
ListView is a view group that displays a list of scrollable items. The list items are automatically inserted to the list using an Adapter that pulls content from a source such as an array or database query and converts each item result into a view that's placed into the list.

Spinners provide a quick way to select one value from a set. In the default state, a spinner shows its currently selected value. Touching the spinner displays a dropdown menu with all other available values, from which the user can select a new one.

Regarding the ListView you could an ArrayAdapter to populate it or you could create your own Custom Adapter.

The project contains some very basic examples that could be used to understand the concept of adapter and how to bind a list of Strings or objects to a ListView.
